        ### Developers Immersed in Development 
        ### I'm Hongseok Choi.
        
        "Effort creates opportunity, opportunity creates experience, experience creates knowledge."
        
        I'm trying to experience anything with this value.
        Thanks to my steady efforts, I won a suburban competition and have experience running various booths outside.  
        
        We value the user experience.
        I have the experience of being immersed in school and external projects in line with the standards.
