        <br>- Leaders (ENFJ) often feel compelled to strive for a great mission in their lives. With a thoughtful and idealistic streak, leaders do their best to make a positive impact on others and the world around them, and they do not hesitate to take the opportunity to do the right thing even in difficult situations. <br><br>
        - Leaders are born leaders, and many are politicians, coaches, and teachers. Their passion and charisma affect others not only in their jobs but also in many aspects of their lives, such as human relationships. They also find pleasure and deep satisfaction in helping friends and loved ones develop. <br><br>
