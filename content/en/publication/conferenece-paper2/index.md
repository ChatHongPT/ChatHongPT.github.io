  1) Use ChatGPT-generated deliverables for cyberattacks

  ChatGPT makes it easier to write a large amount of phishing emails, allows delicate modifications, and makes phishing emails more sophisticated than before, allowing overseas attackers to write natural phishing emails by resolving linguistic limitations. As it becomes possible to advance and mass-produce fake data that can be used for various cyberattacks such as spam and smishing as well as phishing mail, attackers' attack costs are decreasing and the scale of damage is increasing.

  2) Malicious code generated by ChatGPT

  ChatGPT's code generation function can be exploited to help create hacking tools
  Even the general public without knowledge can more easily create hacking tools through ChatGPT. Generative AI reduces the time cost of developing hacking tools and has the possibility of indiscriminate cybercrime and general crime cybercrime.

  It is impossible to generate malicious code, which is a high level of completion that can be used directly for cyberattacks, and additional expertise is required to modify and supplement the generated source code.

  3) Test the production of malicious code using ChatGPT

  1. Ask to create a ransomware system that encrypts document files

  1)If you ask ChatGPT to generate ransomware malware, it refuses to execute the command.

  2) If you indirectly request the creation of some functions of the ransomware, execute the command.

  2. Creating phishing emails that impersonate famous domestic portal sites to steal account information

  1)If you ask ChatGPT directly to produce a phishing email impersonating Naver Customer Center, they refuse to execute the order.

  2) Remove phishing mail keywords and indirectly execute commands when requesting mail creation.

  In addition, sensitive information such as personal information and company confidential information is likely to be leaked because the information entered by the user in ChatGPT is stored in the OpenAPI server as user content.
  To date, it is not possible to say that ChatGPT has caused actual cyberattacks or increased crimes, but preemptive measures are needed to identify and mitigate possible security threats in advance. As ChatGPT has become an innovative technology, it is necessary to prepare guidelines for safe use of ChatGPT and strengthen communication cooperation to promote the use of ChatGPT and alleviate side effects.
