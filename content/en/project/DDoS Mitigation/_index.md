## The second project of the White Hat School of the Korea Information Technology Research Institute
(Development of DDoS attack mitigation security equipment in low-spec environments)

The project focused on developing **security equipment** that can leverage **eBPF/XDP** and **BGP** to detect **DDoS attacks in real time and block malicious packets even in low-spec environments. In addition, **ELK Stack** can be used to build monitoring web pages to check real-time network status.

### Key Features:
- **eBPF/XDP based packet filtering**: detect malicious packets in real time and efficiently handle low-spec environments
- **BGP Routing**: Dynamic network path changes to mitigate DDoS attacks
- **ELK Stack Monitoring Web Page**: Provides real-time monitoring dashboard with Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana

### Project Objectives:
1. **DDoS attack mitigation**: Build highly efficient packet monitoring and blocking systems even in low-spec environments
2. **Real-time network monitoring**: Real-time network health monitoring and attack detection via ELK stack
3. **Ensure network stability**: Routing changes using BGP maximize network stability
