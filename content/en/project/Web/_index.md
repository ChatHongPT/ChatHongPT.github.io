### Development of Personalized Speech Recognition Program Considering Phonetic Disorder Pronunciation Characteristics

The project is an AI system developed to allow users with **pronunciation disorders** to use speech recognition programs tailored to their pronunciation characteristics. This allows users to experience more accurate pronunciation recognition and increases the convenience of communication in their daily lives.

#### Key Features:
- **Pronunciation calibration**: AI analyzes users' pronunciation and provides calibrated pronunciation
- **Personalized Learning**: Personalize speech models to suit your pronunciation characteristics
- **Real-time feedback**: Provide interaction with immediate pronunciation recognition and calibration

#### Project Objectives:
1. **Exact speech recognition**: Provides an AI model optimized for user-specific pronunciation characteristics
2. **User-friendly interface**: Intuitive interface design for anyone to use
3. **Expandable model**: Flexible model structure for different types of speech disorders
