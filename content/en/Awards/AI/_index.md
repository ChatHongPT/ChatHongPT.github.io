AI-based fish species discrimination program 'Finding Fish Species'

<!--more-->

The "Tangerine" team (Choi Hong-seok, Kim Tae-han, Noh Ye-hee, Park Ga-young, Son Yoo-jung, and Hong Dae-gun), consisting of students from Chonbuk National University's IT Information Engineering Department, Busan National University, Jeju National University, and Wonkwang University, won the grand prize (3 million won in prize money) at the GREAT Chat GPT Idea Competition. The competition was held in the form of a three-night, four-day camp on Jeju Island (2024.1.30~2.2) with students selected from each region from 13 universities participating in the Busan/Jeonbuk/Jeju regional leading universities development project

The theme of the competition is to use Chat GPT to derive community problems that meet the K-SDGs goals as business solution ideas, and Choi Hong-seok drew the attention of the judges with his original idea of "A fish species discrimination service using CHAT GPT-based multi-modal functions - fish species search."

Choi Hong-seok's idea is an application that can simultaneously identify fish species and sizes using AI image analysis technology by utilizing Chat GPT's multi-modal function, and provides solutions to protect endangered species and prevent the spread of foreign species.

This competition focuses on students recognizing community problems and using AI technology to derive creative and practical solutions, and Choi Hong-seok's idea was highly praised for presenting practical and innovative solutions for fishing workers and planning effective commercialization strategies.
