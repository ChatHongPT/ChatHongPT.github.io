The "IJ20" team (Choi Hong-seok, Heo Wan, Jinkyu Lee, and Cho Dae-in), consisting of students from Chonbuk National University's IT information engineering department, won the grand prize (2 million won in prize money) at the "5th Oasis Hackathon".

The Oasis Hackathon, which was promoted as part of the ICT Innovation Square expansion project, began in 2020 and marks its fifth anniversary this year as a networking Hackathon competition held independently by university students in Honam to revitalize the community of university students interested in IT.

The competition was held under the theme of developing AI and ICT services to solve problems in Honam, including education, safety, social and environment, tourism, and start-ups. 85 students participated in the competition with a team of planning, development and design jobs.

The "Honam People" application submitted by the IJ20 team was created using the Kotlin language, and developed an application to revitalize tourism in Honam using dart game travel, which is popular on SNS, and received good reviews from the judges.
